# FreeWebNovel Scraper üï∑Ô∏è

A Scrapy-based web crawler that downloads novels from freewebnovel.com. It scrapes book covers and chapter contents into organized text files. Because manually copying chapters is for suckers.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install scrapy pillow beautifulsoup4 lxml
   ```
3. Run the spider (see examples below)

## Usage

Scrape a specific number of books from search results:

```bash
scrapy crawl freewebnovel -a query="My Vampire System"
```

Scrape random books from specific genres (comma-separated list supported):

```bash
scrapy crawl freewebnovel -a targets=20 -a genre=Romance
scrapy crawl freewebnovel -a targets=50 -a genre=Harem
```

Genre examples: Harem, Romance, Smut, Action

## Output 

Books are saved in `output/BookTitle/` with:
- `Chapter-X.txt` files for each chapter
- Book cover image in the same directory

## Configuration

Modify `freewebnovel_scraper/settings.py` to adjust:
- Download delays
- Concurrent requests
- Image storage settings

# Roadmap for the future.
- Well, I don't really have any "roadmap" for this side project.
- If I'm bored enough in the future, well, then updates may come, extending support to other novel sites or manga reading sites. For now, it only supports freewebnovel.
- If ya'll want, you can contribute to this side project, I may not really notice it though, since I don't use GitHub that much.
